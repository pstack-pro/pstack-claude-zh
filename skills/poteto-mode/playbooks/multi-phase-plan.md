### 多阶段或多 PR 计划

**计划归你，代码不归你。计划是一份清单，负责人按勾选框逐项去勾，操作者凭证据来审。** 交付物就是这份计划。不要实现。

1. 改动只有一两个文件、做法也明显，就跳过计划。说一声，然后停下。
2. 动笔之前，先用原型把没定的问题定下来。每个问题跑一遍 `playbooks/prototype.md`。分支、SHA 和截图留到附录 A。只有任何一次运行都定不了的产品或偏好取舍，才问操作者，并且给出选项（**never-block-on-the-human** 原则 skill）。
3. 探索交给子代理，用 `subagent_type: "pstack:poteto-agent"`，模型按 Subagents 一节明确指定（**guard-the-context-window** 原则 skill）。推理强度、用 fast 还是标准速度，也按 Subagents 一节、照这项工作来选。每个子代理只交回文件指针、约定、测试命令和入口。不要把大段内容贴回来。
4. 把下面的骨架抄进计划文件，每个占位符都填上。操作者没指定路径时，写到 agent 存储目录的 `docs/` 下。标题和子块全部保留，顺序不变。一个 PR 一节。一个 PR 就是一项改动，带着自己的证据（**sequence-verifiable-units** 原则 skill）。在 **How to read this** 里写明执行 playbook。`playbooks/autopilot-full.md` 和 `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md` 二选一，依据是 `playbooks/autopilot-stack.md` 末尾的规则。长期跑着的项目用 `playbooks/orchestrate.md`。
5. 全文按 `/pstack:technical-writing` 写，然后跑 `/pstack:unslop`。正文只用一种 Diátaxis 模式，how-to。explanation 和 reference 放在附录。每个标题写出任务，或写出发现。不用长破折号。句子中间不用冒号。
6. 运行 `node pstack/skills/poteto-mode/scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>`，把它打印的每一行都修好（**encode-lessons-in-structure** 原则 skill）。
7. 交回来。贴出计划路径和脚本的输出，然后停下。执行要等操作者明确说开始，并按计划点名的执行 playbook 走。

**验证。** 光有测试不算充分的验证。unit、live、perf 三类勾选框全部勾上，这个 PR 才算验证过（**prove-it-works** 原则 skill）。这句话就是验证规则。每个验证块都以它开头。live 块**必须**有。在 PR 的 head 上开十条 lane，按 **swarm** skill，用 `swarm workers` 模型（默认 `sonnet`），通过这个界面的 control skill 去驱动真实界面。每条 lane 是一个勾选框，写明具体场景、要存的截图、通过条件。其中一条是 **Regression lane against trunk.**（对照 trunk 的回归 lane）。它在 trunk 和 head 上跑同一个关键场景。trunk 上还没有这个功能时，这条 lane 记下这个事实，改为约束 diff 新增的行为，以及用户最终等到的那个状态，不要编造 trunk 上的结果。性能关卡是双边的。trunk 和 head **必须**都产出点名的那个指标。trunk 上没有这个功能时，还要把 diff 新增的工作单独拆出来，给这部分工作、以及用户等待的端到端状态定一个绝对预算。场景对不上时，不要报比值。性能块要写明指标、交错跑的探测、先在 trunk 上量到的基线，以及带失败数字的规则。改了交互的 PR 要过评审关卡。合并之前，操作者在聊天里看截图和一段视频。没改交互的 PR 写 `**Review gate.** None. <PR id> is not review-gated.`，下面不放勾选框。

**Control skill。** 按界面选。浏览器、Electron 和 web 界面用 `cursor-team-kit` 的 `control-ui`。CLI 和 TUI 用 `cursor-team-kit` 的 `control-cli`。原生移动端用仓库里已有的、能驱动模拟器的 skill。一个 PR 碰到两个界面，两边都要有 lane。没有 control skill 的界面，作为风险写进附录 C。它的 live 块仍然要写明每条 lane 怎么驱动。

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a screenshot, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `pstack/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`. <Who merges, and which PR ids are the operator's items that stop at merge-ready.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol and this plan to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] Read these from trunk at program start. Re-read them at every tick.
  - [ ] `git show origin/main:pstack/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/<execution playbook>.md`
  - [ ] `git show origin/main:pstack/skills/swarm/SKILL.md`
  - [ ] `git show origin/main:<control skill path>`
  - [ ] `git show origin/main:pstack/skills/poteto-mode/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`
  - [ ] `git show origin/main:pstack/skills/<each other leaf skill the program uses>`
- [ ] On the operator's go, arm the audit tick as `/loop 1h` with the tick prompt below. Never leave the cadence to memory.
- [ ] Use this tick prompt, verbatim. "Re-read the execution playbook from trunk. Audit the operation against it and fix drift in this tick. Probe every active lane and judge progress by side effects only. Stand down a stuck lane and dispatch its replacement now. Then post a short status message to the operator in chat only when the audit found a tracked change that no earlier status message reported, such as a PR opened, a code-ready head, a round launched or closed, a verdict, a merge, a stuck agent and the action taken, a blocker added or cleared, or a decision only the operator can make. Name every such change and nothing else. Do not repeat a table, the merged list, or an unchanged blocker. If the audit found none, end the turn with no reply text. Either way, log this tick's row in your decision trail. The row names the items reported, or none."
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, send every owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Spawn owners

- [ ] Spawn one owner per PR with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent merges, or base it on the parent branch when the execution playbook stacks.
  - [ ] <PR id> and <PR id> are independent and first. Both branch from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with screenshots and a video before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Resolve the forge once. Default to `gh`; if `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, use `origin pr` for every PR operation. Record any fallback to `gh`. Never require `gt`.
- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, per **Opening a PR**. Use the run's built-in PR tool when it has one, else `origin pr create --status open --base <base-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <base-branch>` according to the resolved forge. A stack child targets its parent branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run `/deslop` before each commit and `/pstack:no-comments` before review.
- [ ] Triage every Bugbot and security-reviewer comment per `../references/bugbot-triage.md`.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before the code-ready report and babysit. Keep that merge base in fix rounds. Rebase again only at merge prep, on a `git merge-tree` conflict with trunk, or on a CI failure that comes from a change on trunk.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] A full swarm runs once, at the code-ready head. Another full swarm runs only for new behavior, a redesign, or a large new diff. A rebase, a merge-conflict resolution, or a minor fix gets a single verifier at the new head. Run each full swarm per `pstack/skills/swarm/SKILL.md`. One gates lane. The ten live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf lane from its **Verify, perf** block. Two or more audit lanes, each with its own focus, that read the diff and the receipts and distrust the PR body. The root audits the receipts in the merge-ready report before the verdict.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner, including a defect that a lane filed as a note. A new head gets a fresh verdict, except for results that stay valid under the patch-id rule in `playbooks/shipping.md`.
- [ ] <The merge or append rule from the execution playbook, with the patch-id rule from `playbooks/shipping.md`.>

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs on its own cloud VM at the PR head. Drive through `control-ui` or `control-cli` from `cursor-team-kit`.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the control skill's commands. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every screenshot to `/tmp/swarm-<pr-id>/worker-<n>/<slug>.png` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. Ten lanes on `<swarm workers model>` at the PR head, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. Regression lane against trunk. Run <the same load-bearing scenario> at trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that and gate <the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for>. Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 3. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 4. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 5. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 6. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 7. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 8. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 9. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 10. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>.png`. Pass when <predicate>.

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> screenshots into `<media path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>.png`.
- [ ] Record a 30 to 60 second video of the change on a lane VM. Save it as `<media path>/<pr-id>-review.mp4`.
- [ ] Post the screenshots and the video in chat. Stop at merge-ready. Wait for the operator's click.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Bugbot triage done.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] <The owner squash-merges its own PR, or the root appends it to the base-branch stack and the operator lands it bottom-up.>

## Close the program

- [ ] Every box above is checked with its evidence.
- [ ] Reply to the operator with the report the execution playbook names.

## Appendix A. Prototype evidence

<Each open question a prototype answered, with the branch, the SHA, and the artifact links. Each question that stays unproven.>

## Appendix B. Alternatives rejected

<Each approach weighed and why it lost.>

## Appendix C. Risks

<Each risk with the PR it lands in and what the owner watches.>

## Appendix D. Links and reading list

<Docs to read before editing. Which PRs get `pstack/skills/how/SKILL.md` and `pstack/skills/interrogate/SKILL.md`. The trail per `pstack/skills/show-me-your-work/SKILL.md`.>
